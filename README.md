## üìã Prerequisites

- **PHP**: `^8.2`
- **Laravel**: `^12.0`
- **Composer**: Latest version
- A web server (e.g., Apache/Nginx) with MySQL for the database

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vickypandey14/laravel-web-based-artisan-command-executor.git
   cd laravel-web-based-artisan-command-executor
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment**:
   - Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:
     ```bash
     cp .env.example .env
     ```
   - Generate an application key:
     ```bash
     php artisan key:generate
     ```

4. **Configure Database**:
   - Update your `.env` file with your MySQL database credentials:
     ```
     DB_CONNECTIONmysql
     DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
     DB_PORT=3306
     DB_DATABASE=command_executor
     DB_USERNAME=root
     DB_PASSWORD=
     ```
   - Ensure your MySQL server is running and the database `command_executor` exists (or update the `DB_DATABASE` value to match your database name).

5. **Run Migrations**:
   ```bash
   php artisan migrate
   ```

6. **Serve the Application**:
   - Start the Laravel development server:
     ```bash
     php artisan serve
     ```

7. **Access the Application**:
   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`.

## üìñ Usage

1. **Navigate to the Command Runner**:
   - From the homepage, click on the "Command Runner" link in the navigation bar.

2. **Run a Command**:
   - Enter an Artisan command (e.g., `make:model Post -mcr`) in the input field and click "Run Command".
   - Alternatively, select a command from the "Common Commands" dropdown or use the instant action buttons (e.g., "Model + Migration + Controller").

3. **View Output**:
   - The command output will be displayed in the "Command Output" section.
   - The command and its output will also be logged in the "Command History" section.

4. **Clear History**:
   - Click the "Clear History" button to remove all logged commands.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Note

This tool allows execution of arbitrary Artisan commands via a web interface, which can be dangerous in a production environment. It is recommended to:
- Restrict access using Laravel authentication middleware (e.g., `auth`).
- Whitelist allowed commands to prevent destructive actions (e.g., `db:wipe`).
- Use this tool in a development environment only.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Scripts

The following scripts are available in `composer.json`:

- **Start Development Environment**:
  ```bash
  composer dev
  ```
  This runs the Laravel server, queue listener, and logs tailing concurrently.

- **Run Tests**:
  ```bash
  composer test
  ```

## ü§ù Contributing

Contributions are welcome! To contribute:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature`).
3. Make your changes and commit them (`git commit -m "Add your feature"`).
4. Push to your branch (`git push origin feature/your-feature`).
5. Open a Pull Request.

Please ensure your code follows Laravel's coding standards (use `composer pint` to format code) and includes tests where applicable.
